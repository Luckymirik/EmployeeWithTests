# EmployeeWithTests
Educational project Spring and Mockito
In the current homework, we will return to working on the employee book, which we developed during the 1st course and which we returned to in the 1st assignment. The goal of this homework is to cover the project (its services) with the maximum number of tests.

Write a new DepartmentController controller that will receive information by department. The controller must delegate tasks to the DepartmentService.
The controller only accepts requests and returns results. The calculation itself is carried out by the DepartmentService service, which takes all employees using EmployeeService and performs the necessary operations.
